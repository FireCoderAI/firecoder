1. **Customize Prompt Quality**: If you prefer, you can adjust the settings to use larger models for higher-quality prompts. This option allows you to fine-tune your coding experience based on your preferences and requirements.

2. **Efficient Response Times**: FireCoder is designed to return answers swiftly, even on less powerful computers. The extension automatically adjusts the context size to ensure that responses are generated within one second, ensuring a seamless coding experience.

3. **Consider Manual Mode for multi-line hints**: While auto mode is convenient for quick prompts, it typically returns only a single line. If you need more extensive prompts or multiple lines of code suggestions, consider switching to manual mode for a more comprehensive experience.
